I made this bot for my discord server

I'm actually working on the Music module. I'm trying to keep light as possible. 

Next modules : 

Users can manage their own roles using the bot 
Growing dictionary that maps user input to an answer 

Maybe one day: 
Mini games with the bot (any)


I do all this to learn more about python and make my server better.
